** Summary

Yet another rewrite of my Emacs configuration. I've decided to get rid
of literate config, because I'm not always keeping it up-to-date.

So, in a nutshell, this is a vanilla Emacs configuration that
supports:
- Common and intuitive key combinations for basic text manipulation;
- (coming soon) Ergonomic and easy-to-remember text navigation keys;
- Programming functionality on-par with VSCode.

My main use-cases for Emacs are:
- Editing source code and configuration files;
- Browsing directories and files on local and remote devices;
- Calling shell commands through =async-shell-command= and =compile=
  (full-blown terminal is not a priority);
- Writing markdown for all sorts of things;
- Interacting with git repositories, as =magit= is literally the best
  git interface I know of.

** Long-term goals (LTG) of the configuration
1. To be able to support different use-cases as separated Emacs versions;
2. Minimize friction when switching between regular applications and
   Emacs (meaning, to keep common keyboard shortcuts familiar);
3. Introduce more ergonomic keys for text navigation;
4. Support both terminal and GUI versions with minimal differences in
   functionality.

** Short-term goals (TODO list)
1. Get rid of wakib-keys, because they contradict LTG #4, and
   subsequently rewrite keys from scratch;
   - [ ] Rewrite keys from scratch;
   - [ ] Move navigation keys to overriding-terminal-local-map;
   - [ ] (Optional) Create another overriding-map for CUA keys;
   - [ ] Try out cua-mode, and if not good enough recreate C-d and C-e;
   - [ ] Gather all global keys in basic-config into one piece of code;
   - [ ] Use Emacs in terminal for a while to find and fix remaining bugs.
2. Write a script which installs these configurations as separate
   .desktop files on Linux systems;
3. Try out Embark.

** Notes

- This configuration uses modular-config by Sidharth Arya. This means
  you can call different configurations from the CLI like this:
  =emacs --config basic --modules "spell-checking llms games"=
  (full list of available configurations and modules is in =init.el=).
- Currently, the old configuration is stored in =config.org=. It's not
  used now, but I'll be keeping it for some time just in case.
- To measure (or debug) Emacs startup time, use =esup=. To
  install it, use =try= from =general-packages=: =M-x try esup= and
  =M-x esup=. Although it might not work in recent versions of Emacs.
